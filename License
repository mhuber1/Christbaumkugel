In Terms of license and copyright I did not want to go through the trouble of finding fitting license template so I created my own. 
First of all if you want to rebuild this project for whatever reason as aprivate person and order a batch of up to 20 Sets of PCBs and components, assemble one for yourself and sell the spares via Ebay (assembled or not) do it and feel free to send me a few bucks via PayPal for my great work.
If however you are a company or want to use my work commercially, send me an email and we will find a solution we are both happy with.
In this case commercially is if you sell more than 19 PCBs or use Images/Code/Schematics/Board-Layout on anything related to anything making mooney.
If you improved my Design and want to share it we are gonna find a solution.
If you publish any of my work (commercially or non comercially) make sure it says either "by mhuber1" or "designed by mhuber1 https://github.com/mhuber1" the last version is obviosly preferred.
If you come accross any case that's not mentioned above write an email.
My email and PayPal address is "joleckmiamoarsch@gmail.com".
