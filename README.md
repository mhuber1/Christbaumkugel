# Christbaumkugeln_2020
 repo for Pcbways, JLCPCBs and NextPCBs Christmas givaway
 
 these PCBs schould be assembled and then hanged onto achristmas tree with U or Omega schaped piece of wire soldered into the holes on top of the right PCB
 
 for the transistors use either BC94x or BD139 not both at the same time
 C1 and C2 are supposed to be 10¬µF tantalum Capacitors
 R2 and R3 are 100kùõÄ resistors in a 1206 package
 the value of R1 and R4 depends on the led color used, for blue and white leds 0 ohm jumpers are recommended
 for all of the leds normal 1206 leds will work but I recommend using 1206 bottom view leds for half the amount
 for the battery holder anything like BK-912 on Digikey will work
 as a color for the soldermask i would use red or green but it doesn't really matter unless you use bottom view leds
 on on pcb there are vias on the upper part this is ment for a hook or a piece of wire that forms a loop to hang it onto a tree
 and last but not least to assemble this christmas ball slide the slots in the pcbs into each other and solder the square pads together.
 
 A proper BOM and images will come as soon as i have the pcbs at home and assembled.
